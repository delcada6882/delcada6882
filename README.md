Hello, my name is Delcada6882.
I'm interested in web-development, game development, and learning as much as I can.
I'm currently learning Django, Vue, and how to use the Spotify API.
I have worked on projects using React, Angular, Vue, and Node.js.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any large project using JS or Python.
You can see my resume and how to reach me at: https://delcada6882.github.io/Resume/
