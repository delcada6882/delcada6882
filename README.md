Hello, my name is Delcada6882.
I'm interested in game development, web-programming, and learning as much as I can.
I'm currently learning Angular and how to use GameMaker Studio 2.
I have worked on projects using React, Node.js, and Javascript.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any large project using JS or Python.
You can see my resume and how to reach me at: https://delcada6882.github.io/Resume/
